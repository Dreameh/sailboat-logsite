        <p>This project is a part of <b> Ã…land Polytechinc </b> and is currently under development
          as a part of a course the school calls the "PoP course" </p>
        <br />
        <p>Before the COVID-19 pandemic occured, the idea was that we were to have raced with <b> SS Agneta </b>
        against other invited schools to see which RC sailboat was the best during several races, while this has now been cancelled,
        the team has instead set the goal on making the sailboat run with new code, that follows the GSG(Google Style Guide) for C++,
        <br/>also setting the focus on making the previous year's code testable and much more efficient. </p>
